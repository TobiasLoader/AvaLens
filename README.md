## AvaLens: Unlocking the Value of Real-World Underutilized Assets

---
### Overview

AvaLens is a groundbreaking project born at ETHOxford 2024, aiming to leverage the strengths of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) technologies to generate real-world value. Our mission is to:
- Encourage real-world exploration by providing cameras on the spot and stimulating outdoor activities, while enabling such activity to generate income.
- Enhance the inherent security and openness of blockchain, and utilize its strength for our platform  
- Provide a solution to the weaknesses, such as the indelible digital footprint and the perceived complexity that deters wider adoption, by introducing an innovative method of financing. AvaLens introduces a platform where users can lend and borrow cameras, and mint their photos as NFTs thereby creating a new value ecosystem.

### Core Features

#### **Camera Lending & Borrowing**: 
Users can list their cameras on AvaLens for others to borrow. This not only generates income for the asset owners but also provides borrowers with the opportunity to try out various cameras on site without the need for a significant upfront investment nor the "carrying chunky camera around and burdening your shoulders" phenomenon.

#### Blockchain-Powered Transactions: 
Leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain, all transactions on AssetChain are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof, ensuring trust among all participants. We leverage the technology powered by Avalanche to **TODO: WRITE THE TECH DETAIL**

#### User-Friendly Interface: 
Despite being built on sophisticated blockchain technology, AvaLens boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface to lower the threshold for entry and encourage wider participation. We provide images themselves as an alternative currency, creating further familiarity and ease in entrance.

#### Real-World Value Generation: 
AvaLens is not just about using blockchain technology; it's about connecting this technology to real-world solutions and generating tangible value for users.

### How It Works

- **Asset Listing**: Users can check available cameras, as well as all the photos from the real world taken by the cameras in our system.

- **Asset Discovery & Booking**: Borrowers can browse the platform for available cameras and book them to use on the spot.
- **Asset Exchange**: In exchange of the payment, the borrower receives the booked camera and uses it for the agreed period.

- **Return & Settlement**: After the rental period, the asset is returned to the owner, and the smart contract automatically processes the payment, transferring the rental fee to the owner. Potential issues between the two parties is insured through our colateral mechanism.

- **Smart Contracts**: Booking and transactions are secured by our smart contracts on chain, encapsulating the terms of the agreement. This contract ensures the security and fulfillment of the transaction, blocking away the potential implicity in the system.

### Value Proposition

- **Mining Unutilized Assets**: AvaLens taps into the vast pool of underutilized assets, turning dormant cameras into available item for quality improvement in life and active income for users.
- **Creating New Value**: Beyond mere rental income, AvaLens fosters a sharing economy, enabling access to high-quality assets that many could not afford otherwise and generating new value from existing assets, while creating a platform where people can visit scenes clipped from our beautiful reality.
- **Authenticity of experience**: By ensuring that all cameras are securely registered within our chain and proving that the images come from the cameras, we establish a community platform where nothing is fake, AI-generated, or fabricated.
